(notes written before the meeting)
- What I did:
	setting up the environment of UDAPTER
  	divide the dataset into training, val and test ACCORDING TO UDAPTER PAPER

- Next:
	- passing the datasets through the model (predict)
	- writing the scripts to train the model on the new datasets

(notes written during the meeting)

Questions:
can we use prefix tuning on our project?

Next steps:
start survey reading 
	which delta tuning methods could you use?
	is prefix tuning useful for our task (binary classification)
	what is prefix tuning exactly lol

summarize papers

  read well dader
  read well paper summarize delta tuning

run dader
	does it work?
	what feature extractor are they using? - bert-base-multilingual-cased
	ditto? what's that
 
open repo

you know what you could actually do? Write a little summary for each type of delta tuning you want to experiment with

General notes:

the structure of your thesis should be similar to that of DADER paper
