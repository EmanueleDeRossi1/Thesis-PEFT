### TITLE OF THE PAPER

## What the apper says in few words

## Datasets 
There are two datasets used:

- The benchmark datasets from DeepMatcher and Magellan, which covers various domains such as product, citation, and restaurant. Each dataset comprises entities from two relational tables with multiple attributes and a set of labeled matching/non-matching entity pairs.

For instance, the DBLP-Scholar (DS) dataset consists of two tables extracted from DBLP and Scholar, each with four aligned attributes (Title, Authors, Venue, Year). This dataset contains 28,707 entity pairs, including 5,347 matching pairs.


- The WDC product datasets, collected from e-commerce websites, each containing four categories: computers, cameras, watches, and shoes, with 1100 labeled entity pairs per category.


The target dataset (DT) is split into a validation set (DT_val) and a test set (DT_test) with a ratio of 1:9.
